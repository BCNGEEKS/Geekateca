## BOX MODEL

In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

The box model is essentially a box wrapped around every HTML element, consisting of:

- Content
- Padding
- Border
- Margin

The content is the main content of the box, where the text and images appear.

The padding is an area around the content to create space around it, inside of any defined border. This padding is normally transparent.

The border goes around the content and padding.

The margin is used to create space around elements, outside of any defined border. The margin is normally transparent.

The outline, not considered part of the box model, is a line drawn around elements, outside the border, to make the element "stand out".
