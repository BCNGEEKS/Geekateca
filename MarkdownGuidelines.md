# Markdown Guidelines

The title will also appear in the index, so make it descriptive while brief! Use only one h1!

## First section

You can use as many h2 as you want. They indicate a general section in your content.

## Examples

Use code snippets for your examples! For that indent 4 spaces:

    The <a> tag should only by used for hyperlinks.

You can also do small code snippets using the ` ` ` character. 

For example: The `<a>` tag should only be used for hyperlinks.

## Lists

There are two kind of lists: ordered or unordered. Please use them accordingly, sorting only a series of consecutive steps causally connected.

Sometimes lists like to misbehave so adding a `<!-- end of the list -->` at the end of them prevents any problems.

    There are different kind of selectors in HTML:

    - id: must be unique
    - name: must be unique
        - id and name have different properties in <form>
    - class: can be repeated

    <!-- end of the list -->
