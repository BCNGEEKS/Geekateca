## SYNTAXIS CSS

An element in CSS is called a rule.

A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.

The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.

The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.

Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.

Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.

### EXAMPLE

```CSS
p {
  color: red;
  text-align: center;
}
```
